Project Setup
-------------
1. Inside the project's root directory, run `npm install`. The `npm install` command downloads and installs any additional node modules needed to run the Grunt tasks that are required for the build process - defined in **package.json**.
2. Launch the development server by running `ionic serve` from the project's root directory. This should open a browser window at [http://localhost:8100]('http://localhost:8100') and reload the page any time a change is saved to any html, js, css/sass, or image within the **src** folder.
